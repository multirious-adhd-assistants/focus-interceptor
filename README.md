# hyperfocus-interceptor

***WIP***

Most people probably just need a timer (such as the Pomodoro method) to stop their hyperfocus.
Well, I need a little bit more than that.

Features:
- Notifcation (pop up/sound)
- Advanced scheduler  
  Not just a simple timer for signaling break time.
- Input blocking  
  Stop your system from responding to input.
- Induced distraction  
  Automatically create distraction.

Break time scheduling methods (Methods available to be used in the scheduler):
- [ ] Time
- [ ] Input monitor
- [ ] Window event
